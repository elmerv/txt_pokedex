    <h1>TXT Labs Coding Instructor Project</h1>

    <p>Let's implement a basic Pokedex Tool.</p>
    <p>We are looking for:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        A dropdown that has a list of pokemon (at least 5) that the user can use
        to set the currently active Pokemon.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        A card should be displayed for the active Pokemon. It should contain the
        name, image, and a brief description of the active Pokemon.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        'Previous' and 'Next' buttons that, when pressed, will set the previous
        or next Pokemon as active. When the Pokemon changes, also change the
        text color, and background color to fit the Pokemon's theme (color
        scheme)
      </li>
      <br />
    </ol>

    <p>
      The interface does not have to be pristine, but we are looking for bug
      free functionality. Therefore, we recommend you focus on the functionality
      before spending too much time on the interface.
    </p>

      We set up the project for you. Please fork the project and complete the
      missing sections. Once you are ready, send us the link to the forked
      project.
